<h1>The best movies (yes, the best) according to Jeff</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Hunt For Red October</h3>
<p>A great book turned into an even better movie!</p>
<h3>A Christmas Story</h3>
<p>This is a must watch every Christmas season!</p>
<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>Great action, great suspense, great comedy! And I dare you to try to convince me that this isn't a Christmas movie!
